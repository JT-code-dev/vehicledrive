# Drive a Vehicle

## Introduction
This is a node.js application you can run from the command line to simulate driving a vehicle - car, truck, or motorbike. The user can enter in vehicle details and find out if they can be towed, tow someone else, or even pop a wheelie on a motorcycle.

## Installation

Just open the file in the terminal and enter 'npm run start' from the command line, to activate node with inquirer.

### Project Status

Working on fixing bugs that came up last minute.

## Usage

Use this app to pretend to drive a car, pop a wheelie, tow or be towed. This would be great for a vehicle dealer or shop.

## Contributions

Please contribute however you see fit, and help me fix the bugs! I have been looking at it for too long!
